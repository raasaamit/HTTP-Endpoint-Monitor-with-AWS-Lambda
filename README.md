# HTTP-Endpoint-Monitor-with-AWS-Lambda
This project is a serverless application that uses AWS Lambda to monitor the health of HTTP endpoints. It fetches endpoint URLs from a DynamoDB table, performs health checks, and sends alerts via Amazon SNS if any endpoint fails. Built with .NET 8, itâ€™s designed for reliability and easy deployment.
